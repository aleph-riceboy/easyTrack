# easyTrack
Java program built for ISU4U as a final project to keep track of IT hardware. Me and my groupmate decided to create a program for his father to solve a problem at his workplace.
My groupmate's father is in charge of IT and has to keep track of many different types of hardware in his organization across Canada. EasyTrack is designed to make this this process of hardware tracking more accessible and easier for users.
The father is currently using this program at his workplace.
